According to Zip's Law, predicted proportion of a word occuring n times in a document is 1/n*(n+1).

Hence, calculating total proportion for words occuring 1, 2, 3 and 4 times is,

Predicted Proportion = (1/1*2) + (1/2*3) + (1/3*4) + (1/4*5)
		     = (1/2) + (1/6) + (1/12) + (1/20)
		     = 0.8

For given text in Alice in Wonderland document, total ommitted words with frequency 1, 2, 3 and 4
are 1935 and total unique words are 2632. (These values can be verified by running p1b.sh script)

Hence, Actual Proportion = 1935/2632 = 0.735182.

Hence, predicted proportion and actual proportions are very close. Hence Alice in Wonderland document
almost follows Zip's Law.
