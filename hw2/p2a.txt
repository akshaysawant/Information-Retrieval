According to Heap's Law,

	v = k.n^β

where v is vocabulary size e (number of unique words), 
n is the number of words in corpus,
k, β are parameters that vary for each corpus.

Hence, for complete document,
	v = k.n^0.5	-------------- (1)

Assume, x proportion of a collection of text must be read before 90% of its
vocabulary has been encountered. Hence, we get,

	0.9v = k.(x.n)^0.5 ----------- (2)

Solving equations (1) and (2),
	x = 0.81

Hence, 81% proportion of a collection of text must be read before 90% of its 
vocabulary has been encountered.
