was that
that it
it might

of the
the doors
doors of
of the
the hall
hall but
but alas
alas either
either the
the locks

that it
it led
led into
into a
a small
small passage

not much
much larger
larger than

down and
and looked

along the
the passage
passage into
into the
the loveliest
loveliest garden
garden you
you ever

how she
she longed

to get

out of
of that
that dark
dark hall
hall and
and wander
wander about
about among
among those
those beds
beds of
of bright
bright flowers

not even
even get
get her
her head
head through
through the
the doorway
doorway and
and even
even if

my head
head would

no use
use in
in waiting
waiting by
by the
the little
little door
